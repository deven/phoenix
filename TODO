Install Bugzilla at bugzilla.gangplank.org, start tracking there instead.

Create mailing lists for users, administrators, developers, and announcements.

Use getrlimit(), setrlimit() and sysconf() in addition to getdtablesize().

Add support for poll(), possible Linux's poll2() and NetBSD's kqueue, in
addition to select().

Possibly add native Winsock support to avoid Cygwin dependencies, using either
asynchronous I/O or (preferably) I/O completion ports under NT, if available.

Possibly port to Visual C++ if it doesn't work out of the box?

Start using autoconf (and automake?) to avoid manual configuration.

Help automate basics like admin account setup, guest access, port number, etc.

Review old Phoenix TODO list for relevant tasks.

Extract help text into separate files.

Write new command parser, move command implementations from Session class into
individual command implementation classes.

Create new classes for input editing and terminal handling, instead of having
the Telnet class deal with these things directly.
