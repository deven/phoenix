When matching a name for a sendlist, exact matches always work, a *unique*
leading match takes precedence over middle matches, and middle matches will
work if unique.  Case is ignored for matching.  If a match fails, the failing
match string and ALL possible matches are shown.  If a leading match is not
unique, all matches, both leading and middle, are shown.

It is now possible to transfer an attached session to a new connection.

Default names are now reserved.

here/away/busy/gone states

As for how I see the states, I see "here" as meaning "I'm around, and
I'll probably respond if you talk to me", "away" meaning "I'm around,
but I might be a bit inattentive", "busy" meaning "I may be here, but
I don't want to be bugged", and "gone" meaning "I'm probably gone and
won't even see a message right away, much less respond."

Idle times are now reset whenever user input causes a visible status
change as well as messages and manual resets.  Intentional detach, but
not accidental detach, attach, blurb changes, here/away/busy/gone, etc
all reset the idle time now.  An idle time may now be set with the
command "/idle=<time>", but not longer than signed-on time.

Infinite names and blurbs are now accepted.

Multiple sendlists are now supported.

Movement within a line with up/down arrows is now supported.
