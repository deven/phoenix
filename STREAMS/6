Raph,

        I like your approach.

        I don't know if you ever saw an Evans & Sutherland PS300, but in
that product I implemented a general form of what you're describing --
called "Function Networks" -- for processing input device streams [tablet,
knobs, keyboard, pushbuttons, serial lines, ...], driving both the host
process and  real-time display structures.  Each function network instance
had multiple inputs and multiple outputs, if you desired them, some of
which were streams and some were constants [e.g., crypto keys, in our
case].

        The structure made network stacks downright trivial, although that
wasn't its purpose.  I've been thinking for some time that it would make a
good language for describing composed crypto functions [e.g., my favorite
des|tran|des|tran|des].  Your structure should be good for that as well.

 - Carl
