Special thanks are due to Ron Frederick <frederick@timeheart.net> for his
invaluable assistance during original development, for catching the FD_SETSIZE
bug that broke the Cygwin build, and for helping to break the dependency on
-lstdc++ for GCC 3.x versions.  Thanks, Ron!

Drew Card <drew@phoenix-cmc.org> also deserves special thanks for his tireless
efforts at beta testing, and particularly for discovering the buffer overflow
vulnerability which was fixed in version 1.0.0.beta.9.  Thanks, Drew!
