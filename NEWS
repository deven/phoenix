November 22, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.7

 * This release applies GCC-specific compiler options only to GCC compilers,
   and also increases the number of connections supported under Cygwin to 256.

November 21, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.6

 * This release integrates autoconf/automake so "./configure; make" can be
   used to build Gangplank.  Configure options exist to disable guest access
   and/or change the default TCP port used by the server.  This release also
   fixes the ANSI terminal-handling bugs related to line wrapping.

September 10, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.5

 * Thanks to Ron Frederick <frederick@timeheart.net>, this release supports
   Cygwin on Win32 systems, and no longer depends on "-lstdc++" under GCC 3.x.
   (See RELEASES file for more details.)

August 22, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.4

 * This release adds support for Macintosh OS X and GCC 3.1.

December 12, 2001: Version 1.0.0.beta.3

 * This is a portability release.  Gangplank now builds with GCC 2 or 3 on
   Linux (including newer distributions), BSD systems, and Solaris.  See the
   RELEASES and PORTING files for more details.

December 2, 2001: Version 1.0.0.beta.2

 * Forgot to test the initial release; it's a "brown paper bag" release
   that fails to compile.  See the RELEASES file for more details.  This
   release has been tested, and fixes the minor bug in the first release.

November 30, 2001: Version 1.0.0.beta.1

 * Initial Open Source release of Gangplank conferencing system.
