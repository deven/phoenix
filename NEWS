September 18, 2003: Version 1.0.0.beta.11

 * Modified server startup to double-fork and close I/O to better disconnect
   from the parent process.  (Without this, crond was waiting with -cron.)

 * Added support for multiple reserved names per user account.

 * Added support for application-mode cursor sequences.

 * Added privileged session override to /appoint command.

 * Fixed various bugs (including several crashing bugs) related to the log
   file, backslashes at the end of input lines, login timeout and double join.

February 24, 2003: Version 1.0.0.beta.10

 * This release now uses configured directories instead of "~/lib/gangplank"
   under the running user.  Most required functions now fail at configure
   time instead of compile time.  The "restart" utility has been retired, in
   favor of a new "-cron" option to the server.  The "most.cc" hack has also
   been retired as the argument for it is no longer compelling.  A minor bug
   involving session transfer has also been fixed.

February 21, 2003: Version 1.0.0.beta.9

 * [SECURITY] This release fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability present in
   all development releases up through 1.0.0.beta.8 involving vsprintf/sprintf
   calls with 32K buffers.  This release replaces calls to the system functions
   with a safe (albeit incomplete) reimplementation.

 * The entire codebase has been audited for other potential buffer overflow
   situations.  A few minor cleanups have been done, but the code appears to
   be clean now.

 * This release also improves the login processing.  There is now a 60-second
   login timeout at all prompts until the user logs in, and a Ctrl-D at any
   of those prompts will drop the connection.  (Both of these are disabled
   after completely logging in.)  Also, invalid login names are no longer
   revealed -- invalid login names now prompt for a password, like valid ones.
   After 3 failed login attempts, the server will drop the connection.  Also,
   a bug allowing duplicate sessions (with the same name) has been fixed.

November 30, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.8

 * This release fixes several portability issues including several introduced
   with autoconf in 1.0.0.beta.6.  (This release works again under Solaris.)
   Added NetBSD, AIX, IRIX and SunOS to the list of supported platforms.

November 22, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.7

 * This release applies GCC-specific compiler options only to GCC compilers,
   and also increases the number of connections supported under Cygwin to 256.

November 21, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.6

 * This release integrates autoconf/automake so "./configure; make" can be
   used to build Gangplank.  Configure options exist to disable guest access
   and/or change the default TCP port used by the server.  This release also
   fixes the ANSI terminal-handling bugs related to line wrapping.

September 10, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.5

 * Thanks to Ron Frederick <frederick@timeheart.net>, this release supports
   Cygwin on Win32 systems, and no longer depends on "-lstdc++" under GCC 3.x.
   (See RELEASES file for more details.)

August 22, 2002: Version 1.0.0.beta.4

 * This release adds support for Macintosh OS X and GCC 3.1.

December 12, 2001: Version 1.0.0.beta.3

 * This is a portability release.  Gangplank now builds with GCC 2 or 3 on
   Linux (including newer distributions), BSD systems, and Solaris.  See the
   RELEASES and PORTING files for more details.

December 2, 2001: Version 1.0.0.beta.2

 * Forgot to test the initial release; it's a "brown paper bag" release
   that fails to compile.  See the RELEASES file for more details.  This
   release has been tested, and fixes the minor bug in the first release.

November 30, 2001: Version 1.0.0.beta.1

 * Initial Open Source release of Gangplank conferencing system.
