This is a brief history of the Gangplank conferencing system.

Initial development of the system began on November 30, 1992.  Gangplank
was finally released (under the Q Public License) on its ninth birthday,
November 30, 2001.  Unreleased versions have run as a production service
(on a private host computer) since March 5, 1993 or earlier, mostly under
the name of "Phoenix".  The name change to "Gangplank" coincides with the
Open Source release on November 30, 2001.

To date, all of the source code has been written by the original author,
Deven T. Corzine <deven@ties.org>.  Due to a rather draconian Intellectual
Property agreement, no development work occurred on this codebase between
July 23, 1996 and March 10, 2000.

During early development, Gangplank was simply called "conf" for lack of
any real name.  Initial development was in C, from November 30, 1992 until
April 8, 1993.  (It was first placed under RCS control on March 5, 1993.)
After that, the codebase was ported to C++ and redesigned as a series of
object-oriended classes.  This redesign was complex, and kept the codebase
in disarray until the first stable C++ version was finally checked into RCS
on December 8, 1993.  At this point, the C version of the server was retired
and the production server was upgraded to the C++ codebase.  "Conf" was
renamed to "Phoenix" on April 21, 1994.

The name was changed to "Gangplank" to coincide with the Open Source release
on November 30, 2001.  A 1.x version number was used for the initial release
of Gangplank because there was already long history under the "conf" and
"Phoenix" names, which could be viewed as (unreleased) 0.x versions.
