Stable Releases
---------------

 * No Gangplank release has been designated "stable" yet.  This is to
   ensure no dumb mistakes (as with version 1.0.0.beta.1) ever occur in
   a release declared "stable" -- every "stable" release will be identical
   to a development release, with only the version number changed.


Development/Test Releases
-------------------------

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.6 (November 20, 2002)

   This release integrates autoconf/automake so "./configure; make" can be
   used to build Gangplank.  Configure options exist to disable guest access
   and/or change the default TCP port used by the server.  This release also
   fixes the ANSI terminal-handling bugs related to line wrapping.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.5 (September 10, 2002)

   Special thanks are due to Ron Frederick <frederick@timeheart.net> for this
   release, which now compiles and runs under Cygwin on Win32 systems, and no
   longer depends on "-lstdc++" under GCC 3.x versions, allowing the "gcc"
   driver to build the server as under GCC 2.x versions.  (Specifically, the
   "-fno-rtti" and "-fno-exceptions" options were needed on the GCC command
   line, pure virtual functions had to be avoided, and new/delete operators
   had to be defined -- these changes removed the dependencies on "-lstdc++".)

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.4 (August 22, 2002)

   Added portability fixes for Macintosh OS X.  Also cleaned up warnings from
   GCC 3.1, mainly from duplicate default parameter initializers.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.3 (December 12, 2001)

   This is a portability release.  The previous release was only tested under
   Red Hat Linux 6.1, but it did not compile on Red Hat Linux 7.2 or other
   current Linux distributions due to glibc changes.  This release has been
   fixed to build on older and newer Linux systems, BSD systems, Solaris, and
   using either GCC 2 or GCC 3.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.2 (December 2, 2001)

   This release simply renames Hash::Hash() to Hash::HashFunction() to
   fix the compilation error in the version 1.0.0.beta.1 release.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.1 (November 30, 2001) [BROKEN]

   This was a "brown paper bag" release.  Forgot to test the release, and
   as it happens, this release doesn't compile.  A class was renamed from
   "Assoc" to "Hash" before the initial release (to avoid confusion), and
   the old Assoc::Hash() method (the hash function) became Hash::Hash(),
   which should be the name of a constructor, of course...
