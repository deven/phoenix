Stable Releases
---------------

 * No Gangplank release has been designated "stable" yet.  This is to
   ensure no dumb mistakes (as with version 1.0.0.beta.1) ever occur in
   a release declared "stable" -- every "stable" release will be identical
   to a development release, with only the version number changed.


Development/Test Releases
-------------------------

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.10 (February 24, 2003)

   This release now uses configured directories, and most required functions
   now fail at configure time.  The "restart" utility has been retired in
   favor of -cron, and the "most.cc" hack has also been retired.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.9 (February 21, 2003)

   This release fixes the buffer overflow vulnerability present in earlier
   releases, and improves login processing (60-second timeout, Ctrl-D to drop
   the connection, prompting for password on invalid login names, dropping the
   connection after 3 failed login attempts, preventing duplicate sessions).

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.8 (November 30, 2002)        *** VULNERABLE RELEASE! ***

   This release fixes several portability issues including several introduced
   with autoconf in 1.0.0.beta.6.  (This release works again under Solaris.)
   Added NetBSD, AIX, IRIX and SunOS to the list of supported platforms.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.7 (November 22, 2002)        *** VULNERABLE RELEASE! ***

   This release applies GCC-specific compiler options only to GCC compilers,
   and also increases the number of connections supported under Cygwin to 256.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.6 (November 21, 2002)        *** VULNERABLE RELEASE! ***

   This release integrates autoconf/automake so "./configure; make" can be
   used to build Gangplank.  Configure options exist to disable guest access
   and/or change the default TCP port used by the server.  This release also
   fixes the ANSI terminal-handling bugs related to line wrapping.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.5 (September 10, 2002)       *** VULNERABLE RELEASE! ***

   Special thanks are due to Ron Frederick <frederick@timeheart.net> for this
   release, which now compiles and runs under Cygwin on Win32 systems, and no
   longer depends on "-lstdc++" under GCC 3.x versions, allowing the "gcc"
   driver to build the server as under GCC 2.x versions.  (Specifically, the
   "-fno-rtti" and "-fno-exceptions" options were needed on the GCC command
   line, pure virtual functions had to be avoided, and new/delete operators
   had to be defined -- these changes removed the dependencies on "-lstdc++".)

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.4 (August 22, 2002)          *** VULNERABLE RELEASE! ***

   Added portability fixes for Macintosh OS X.  Also cleaned up warnings from
   GCC 3.1, mainly from duplicate default parameter initializers.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.3 (December 12, 2001)        *** VULNERABLE RELEASE! ***

   This is a portability release.  The previous release was only tested under
   Red Hat Linux 6.1, but it did not compile on Red Hat Linux 7.2 or other
   current Linux distributions due to glibc changes.  This release has been
   fixed to build on older and newer Linux systems, BSD systems, Solaris, and
   using either GCC 2 or GCC 3.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.2 (December 2, 2001)         *** VULNERABLE RELEASE! ***

   This release simply renames Hash::Hash() to Hash::HashFunction() to
   fix the compilation error in the version 1.0.0.beta.1 release.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.1 (November 30, 2001)            *** BROKEN RELEASE! ***

   This was a "brown paper bag" release.  Forgot to test the release, and
   as it happens, this release doesn't compile.  A class was renamed from
   "Assoc" to "Hash" before the initial release (to avoid confusion), and
   the old Assoc::Hash() method (the hash function) became Hash::Hash(),
   which should be the name of a constructor, of course...
