 * ChangeLog, NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

 * configure.ac: Modified to make most required functions fail in configure
   script instead of waiting until compile time.

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.9 released.

 * ChangeLog, NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

 * session.cc (Session::CheckNameAvailability): Added new function to check for
   availability and later double-check after other prompts to avoid creating
   duplicate sessions with the same name, or infringing newly-reserved names
   or new discussions, etc.

 * session.cc (Session::Transfer): Fixed bug which caused both connections to
   close when transferring a guest session, but then disabled the transfer
   functionality for guests, who weren't meant to have it anyhow.

 * session.h, session.cc (Session::Blurb -> Session::EnteredBlurb): Renamed
   Blurb() to EnteredBlurb().

 * event.h (Event::SetRelTime): Change parameter type from time_t to int.
 * event.cc (ShutdownEvent::FinalWarning, RestartEvent::FinalWarning), event.h:
   Added constants for final warning time in shutdown/restart events.

 * event.cc, event.h, session.cc, telnet.cc, telnet.h: Added login timeout.

 * configure.ac: Added check for crypt() function.
 * makepw.c, session.cc: Modified to generate a compile-time error if crypt()
   is not available.

 * KLUDGES: Removed note about Amiga ANSI terminal types; this was fixed
   earlier to work with proper ANSI terminal types.  Removed note about guest
   account being hardcoded -- it still is, but not it's controlled by the
   configure script, so let's call it a feature!

2003-02-18  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * PORTING: Noted Cygwin support.

 * session.cc, telnet.cc, telnet.h: Implemented CloseOnEOF flag to close on
   Ctrl-D during login sequence.

 * session.h, set.h, string2.h, string.cc, system.h, telnet.cc, telnet.h,
   timestamp.cc, timestamp.h, user.cc, user.h, block.h, boolean.h, constants.h,
   discussion.cc, discussion.h, event.cc, event.h, eventqueue.cc, eventqueue.h,
   fd.h, fdtable.cc, fdtable.h, functions.h, gangplank.cc, gangplank.h,
   general.h, globals.h, hash.cc, hash.h, line.h, listen.cc, listen.h, list.h,
   Makefile.am, makepw.c, most.cc, name.h, object.h, outbuf.h, output.cc,
   output.h, outstr.cc, outstr.h, passwd, pointer.h, restart.c, sendlist.cc,
   sendlist.h, session.cc: Updated copyright dates.

 * bootstrap, configure.ac: Added copyright boilerplate.

 * session.cc (Session::DoWho): Modified to wrap long names only once when
   listing in full -- if the name is still too long, it will simply be wrapped
   by the terminal.

 * string2.h, string.cc: Modified to use size_t type.  Changed Extra constant
   to 128 bytes.  Added assign(), append() and prepend() methods for buffers.
   Avoided unnecessary reallocations for numeric assignments.  Modified %s
   escape in vsprintf() to use new buffer form of append() instead of creating
   a temporary String, and to remove a redundant call to strlen().

 * string.cc (String::vsprintf): Moved variable declarations outside of switch
   statement for portability.

2003-02-17  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * session.cc, session.h: Added MaxLoginAttempts and removed "Login incorrect"
   for invalid logins.

 * user.cc, user.h: Added BufSize constant, increased size to 1024 bytes.
 * timestamp.cc, timestamp.h: Added MaxFormattedLength constant, modified to
   use strncpy() for safety.

 * session.cc: Forgot to fix the comparison when reducing the display of
   discussion titles!

 * string2.h, string.cc (String::vsprintf, String::sprintf): Added functions.
 * gangplank.cc, sendlist.cc, session.cc, telnet.cc: Modified to use
   String::vsprintf() and String::sprintf() in preference to the system
   vsprintf() and sprintf() functions, to avoid buffer overflows.

 * string2.h, string.cc: Added NumberLength constant and operator =() calls for
   numeric assignment.

 * string2.h (String::String): Modified default constructor to allocate extra
   bytes.

 * constants.h, gangplank.cc: Removed DefaultPort constant in favor of using
   configured PORT parameter.
 * constants.h, telnet.h: Moved InputSize constant into Telnet class, increased
   size to 1024 bytes.
 * block.h, constants.h, outbuf.h: Moved BlockSize constant into Block class,
   increased size to 4096 bytes.
 * constants.h, telnet.h: Moved BufSize constant into Telnet class.

 * configure.ac: Updated version number.  Added check for <stdarg.h>.

2002-11-30  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.8 released.

 * ChangeLog, NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

2002-11-26  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * PORTING: Updated portability information.

 * functions.h: If configure did not find strerror(), declare implementation
   prototype.
 * gangplank.cc: Define an implementation of strerror() if not found by
   configure, for very old BSD systems.

 * gangplank.cc: Fixed getpid() back to pid, from last update to startup
   messages.  (Parent process was reporting the wrong pid for child process.)

 * discussion.cc, session.cc, user.cc: Added missing ~ operator where String
   objects were being passed as char *.

 * session.cc: Added [1 person] to message confirmation where a single
   recipient is being addressed via a discussion.

 * acinclude.m4: Added AC_CHECK_SOCKET_LIBS macro for Solaris support.

 * configure.ac: Updated version number.  Added check for <strings.h> header
   for very old BSD systems.  Added check for socket libraries for Solaris.
   Fixed check for socklen_t to include <sys/socket.h> header before checking
   for the type.

2002-11-25  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * makepw.c, restart.c, string.cc, system.h: For very old BSD systems, include
   both <string.h> and <strings.h> if both are available.

2002-11-22  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.7 released.

 * ChangeLog, NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

 * acinclude.m4: Added AC_CXX_EXCEPTIONS and AC_CXX_RTTI macros.
 * configure.ac: Changed version number, added checks for Cygwin environment,
   exceptions and RTTI.  For GCC only, use "gcc" driver instead of "g++"
   (since libstdc++ is not used), added "-Wall" option and (if supported)
   disabled exceptions with "-fno-exceptions" and RTTI with "-fno-rtti".  For
   Cygwin environments, added "-DFD_SETSIZE=256" option to increase the
   maximum number of connections.
 * Makefile.am: Removed compiler flags (moved to configure.ac).

 * Makefile.am: Added "bootstrap" script to distribution archives.

 * gangplank.cc (main): Modified startup messages in logfile to include server
   version number.

2002-11-21  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.6 released.

 * NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

 * string.h -> string2.h: Renamed source file to avoid conflict with
   standard <string.h> include file.
 * Makefile.am, gangplank.h, hash.cc, string.cc: Changed "string.h" to
   "string2.h" to reflect the renamed source file.
 * Makefile.am: Removed DEFAULT_INCLUDES which was suppressing -I of the
   source directory, to allow using a build directory separate from the
   source directory.  (Previously, the semantic difference between using
   #include "string.h" and #include <string.h> resolved the conflict, but
   this fails when -I is used to include files in the source directory.)

 * ChangeLog: New file.

2002-10-30  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * telnet.cc (Telnet::RedrawInput, Telnet::InsertString, Telnet::insert_char,
   Telnet::erase_char, Telnet::delete_char, Telnet::transpose_chars,
   Telnet::upcase_word, Telnet::downcase_word, Telnet::capitalize_word): Fixed
   ANSI terminal-handling problems related to line wrapping.  (This code was
   originally developed for the Amiga ANSI terminal emulation, which may not
   work correctly with this new code, but the new code works correctly with
   standard ANSI terminals, which is more important.)

 * telnet.cc (Telnet::erase_line): Modified erase_line() to call kill_line()
   to place the erased line into the kill-ring instead of discarding it.

2002-09-20  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * session.cc (Session::DoDisplay): Added "/display version" command to show
   Gangplank version.
 * telnet.cc (Telnet::Telnet): Added gangplank version number to the server
   banner message.

 * telnet.cc (Telnet::InputReady, Telnet::OutputReady): Removed EWOULDBLOCK
   and EAGAIN from switch statements because it causes a duplicate-case error
   on some platforms when the same numeric value is used twice.

 * gangplank.cc (OpenLog) [SETVBUF_REVERSED]: Reverse parameters to setvbuf()
   if configure determines it to be necessary.

 * gangplank.cc (main): Avoid compiling the code to background the server
   unless configure found a working fork() function.

2002-09-17  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * INSTALL: Modified instructions to use the new configure script and options.
 * constants.h: Modified DefaultPort to use PORT value from configure script.
 * restart.c: Removed definition of PORT; inherit value from configure script.
 * telnet.cc (Telnet::Welcome): Modified to only output banner message about
   guest access if enabled by configure.
 * user.cc (User::UpdateAll): Modified to only create guest account if
   enabled by configure.

 * makepw.c, restart.c, discussion.cc, fdtable.cc, gangplank.cc, listen.cc,
   sendlist.cc, session.cc, telnet.cc, user.cc: Generate compile-time errors
   if various required functions tested by configure are not available.

 * acinclude.m4: New file.  (Contains configure macro for HAVE_BOOL test.)
 * boolean.h: Modified to rely on configure to determine if builtin "bool"
   type is available in the C++ compiler.
 * string.h: Modified to check HAVE_BOOL (determined by configure) instead of
   BOOL_TYPE (manually configured).

 * bootstrap, depcomp, install-sh, missing, mkinstalldirs, AUTHORS, COPYING:
   New files.

2002-09-16  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Makefile: Removed file.  (Now auto-generated instead.)
 * configure.ac, Makefile.am: New files.
 * system.h, makepw.c: Removed BSD-specific tests.
 * general.h: Stop defining ECONNTIMEDOUT as ETIMEDOUT if missing.
 * telnet.cc: Made ECONNRESET, ECONNTIMEDOUT and ETIMEDOUT cases conditional.
 * gangplank.h, hash.cc, string.cc, makepw.c, restart.c: Included config.h.
 * system.h, string.cc, makepw.c, restart.c: Added conditional checks for some
   includes, based on configure's tests.

2002-09-10  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.5 released.

 * Thanks to Ron Frederick <frederick@timeheart.net>, this release supports
   Cygwin on Win32 systems, and no longer depends on "-lstdc++" under GCC 3.x.

 * NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

 * CREDITS: New file.

 * TODO: Added new items to TODO list.

 * session.cc (Session::DoWho): Changed /who continuations from "]+...+[" to
   "+...>" in case names are long.  (The original was only appropriate for
   blurb continuations, not name continuations.)

 * fdtable.cc (FDTable::Select): Changed select() call to pass only the used
   number of file descriptor slots (which was already being tracked) instead
   of the full size.  (This change is solely for efficiency purposes.)

 * Makefile: Added Cygwin/Win32 support.
 * fdtable.cc (FDTable::FDTable): Modified to take FD_SETSIZE into account.
   This was the portability flaw which kept Cygwin from working.

 * Makefile: Added GCC options to disable RTTI and exceptions (both unused).
   Coupled with other changes to the code, this obviates the need for using
   the "g++" driver to link with -lstdc++.
 * event.h (Event::Execute), fd.h (FD::InputReady, FD::OutputReady,
   FD::Closed), output.h (OutputObj::output): Changed all pure virtual
   functions to call abort() instead, to avoid pulling an error routine
   from libstdc++.
 * general.h, gangplank.cc: Provided basic new/delete operators using malloc
   and free, to avoid pulling a default implementation from libstdc++.
 * gangplank.h: Resequenced include files to include "general.h" before
   "object.h" due to the addition of new/delete prototypes.

2002-08-22  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.4 released.

 * NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

2002-08-13  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * PORTING: Changed Red Hat Linux notes to 6.x and 7.x, since they should all
   work equally well.  Added Macintosh OS X (Darwin) and GCC 3.1.

 * KLUDGES: Documented additional existing kludges.

 * system.h, makepw.c [__APPLE__ && __MACH__]: Added Macintosh OS X test to
   list of BSD-derived systems.

 * system.h: Defined "socklen_t" for BSD-derived systems.

2002-07-28  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * KLUDGES: Removed kludge for object reference counting.
 * object.h (Object::NewReference, Object::DeleteReference): Removed kludge in
   destructor for reference counting, at the cost of an extra test for each
   new reference created.

 * telnet.cc (Telnet::LogCaller): Changed third argument of getpeername() to
   socklen_t for more compatibility.

 * gangplank.cc (OpenLog): Changed setlinebuf() call to setvbuf() equivalent.

 * gangplank.cc, output.cc, sendlist.cc, session.cc, telnet.cc, timestamp.cc:
   Removed duplicate default initializers.  (GCC 3.1.1 caught this error.)

2002-07-09  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Makefile: Removed targets related to "checkin" script (not included in
   distribution).

2001-12-12  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.3 released.

 * NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

 * INSTALL, PORTING: New files.

 * Makefile: Portability fixes for Linux, BSD, Solaris and GCC 3.  Modified to
   build and install utility programs as well as server executable.

 * makepw.c, restart.c (main): Changed return value of main() to int.

 * system.h, string.cc, makepw.c, restart.c: Updated include files for more
   portability.
 * makepw.c (main): Removed declaration of getpass() routine.
 * gangplank.cc (warn, error): Modified to use strerror() instead of sys_nerr
   and sys_errlist.

 * session.cc (Session::DoOops, Session::GetWhoSet, Session::DoWhat): Fixed
   pointer initializations to be more portable.
 * telnet.cc (accept_input): Modified to assign null string instead of null
   pointer to wipe prompt.

 * object.h (Object::~Object): Made Object destructor virtual, just in case.

 * object.h, pointer.h (Pointer::Pointer(int)): Added Pointer constructor for
   int to allow explicit construction of null pointers.
 * fdtable.cc (FDTable::Closed): Modified to explicitly construct null-pointer
   return value.

 * object.h (Object::DeleteReference): Modified DeleteReference() to set a
   negative reference count to allow for some temporary pointers to the object
   being destructed, without calling the destructors again in an endless loop
   when such temporary pointers go out of scope.  Modified the destructor
   sanity check to only check for a positive reference count, due to the above
   modification.
 * KLUDGES: Added description of RefCnt = -1000 kludge in Object class.

 * session.cc (Session::DoDown): Added missing break statements in a switch
   statement.

 * string.h, string.cc: Added various additional operations for completeness,
   including const/non-const variants.

2001-12-02  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.2 released.

 * NEWS, RELEASES: Updated release information.

 * hash.cc, hash.h (Hash::Hash -> Hash::HashFunction): Renamed internal hash
   function which conflicted with the class name.  Changed all callers.

2001-11-30  Deven T. Corzine  <deven@ties.org>

 * Version 1.0.0.beta.1 released.

 * Initial Open Source release of Gangplank conferencing system.

 * Started a new version control history for the public codebase.
