Most of the C++ modules are compiled as a single "most.cc" module via #include
directives.  This is actually faster than compiling all the modules separately
and the executable size is smaller because GCC doesn't include redundant debug
information in each object file.  This seems clumsy, but actually works well.

All help text for the /help command is hardcoded into the source code.  This
kludge was for expediency, to avoid unnecessary file I/O that could block the
single-threaded server and cause network connections to become unresponsive.
No, it's not elegant or convenient.  Yes, this will be changed.

The Session and Telnet classes are larger than they ought to be.  They have
grown and are in need of splitting into further classes when time permits.

The Telnet class currently performs all input editing and terminal handling
functions directly; these should be implemented in separate classes.

Only the ANSI terminal type is supported for user connections.  The "screen"
program mostly works as a workaround.  There are some known bugs in the ANSI
terminal handling for non-Amiga ANSI implementations, including "screen".

Currently, the guest account ("guest") is hardcoded in the "user.cc" file.
This entry overrides any "guest" entry in the password file.  To disable
guest access, comment out the relevant line in "user.cc".
