Phoenix has been known to build and run on the following platforms:

 * Linux (i386) - Red Hat 6.x, 7.x; Debian 2.2; Fedore Core 1
 * FreeBSD 4.x, 5.x (i386)
 * NetBSD 1.6 (i386)
 * OpenBSD 3.2 (i386)
 * Macintosh OS X (Darwin)
 * Solaris 8 (SPARC)
 * SunOS 4.1.4
 * IRIX 6.5.6
 * AIX 4.3.2
 * Cygwin (under Windows)

Phoenix is known to compile with GCC versions from 2.95 through 3.1, using
the "gcc" driver.  (Although Phoenix is written in C++, it does not use the
standard C++ library.)  Phoenix has also been tested with the Sun compiler
under Solaris.

All of these have been tested with some version of the Phoenix code, and
any problems found have been corrected in newer releases.  However, newer
releases have not generally been re-tested against every previously-tested
platform, so new bugs could be present on some platforms.  Whenever possible,
all compiler warnings have been fixed, so hopefully it still builds cleanly
on each of the tested platforms, but no promises!
