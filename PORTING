Gangplank has been successfully compiled on the following platforms:

 * Red Hat Linux 6.x (i386)
 * Red Hat Linux 7.x (i386)
 * Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 "potato" (i386)
 * FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE (i386) [using gmake]
 * Macintosh OS X (Darwin) [using cc]
 * Solaris 8 (SPARC)

Gangplank is known to compile with GCC 2.95 using "gcc", and with GCC 3.0.3
or GCC 3.1 using "g++".  (Although Gangplank does not use any standard C++
libraries, evidently GCC 3 still requires "-lstdc++" for any C++ code.)
